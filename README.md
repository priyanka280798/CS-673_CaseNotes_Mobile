Product Vision:
For healthcare workers(Doctors, nurses, case manager etc) and Patients whose goal is to promote quality patient care through effective communication, The Patient Management System (PMS) is a cloud-based and smartphone-enabled application that will check individual patients, take online appointments, and report to a specific location at a specific time. Unlike the current PMS in which patients go to the hospital to receive their medical reports, patients who use the modified PMS will not only receive their medical reports online, but will also be able to discuss their reports with a specialist, saving them time and increasing patient and doctor satisfaction.

Nearest Vision:
Our nearest vision is to develop the initial deliverable of case notes mobile app, which will have features that let patients and healthcare professionals (such as doctors, nurses, case managers, etc.) view appointment details. This app will get the details from the APIs exposed by the patient appointment portal. The app will also have a straightforward user interface (UI) that even non-technical users can understand.

PERSONA DETAILS:

**Laura, a family nurse practitioner**
 
Laura, age 40, is a family nurse practitioner in Chicago, which is among the largest cities in the U.S. She comes from a family where both of her parents were public servants through which they helped a lot of people. She likes interacting with and helping people in whatever way she can. She also volunteers after work. Laura has completed her education at Duke University with a degree in Doctor of Nursing Practice. She started practicing nursing as soon as she graduated and has been doing the job for the past 15 years.
 
She spends most of her time taking care of patients, writing reports on computers, or transcribing written reports into digital software. She finds this part of her job cumbersome and gets frustrated with how much time she must spend managing reports, as she would much rather spend time with her patients.
 
She has experience using various healthcare software. She believes that the use of software technology can help increase time with patients and consistency in managing reports and patient data. Laura is specifically interested in using Case Notes (Mobile App) to manage communication between doctors and nurses, and their patients. She believes using the application is a smoother way to rely on information from doctors to herself and her fellow nurses and then to the patients to ensure that there is no loss of information or miscommunication between each party and that each case is managed effectively.

 
**Rita, Pharmacist**

Rita, 35, is a pharmacist. She attended pharmacy school in Puerto Rico. After graduation, she worked for an independent pharmacy that was acquired by CVS. Rita believes in making a difference and cherishes the time she spends getting to know her patients. She demonstrates a strong work ethic and genuine optimism. Rita enjoys communicating with the residents of her neighborhood and hopes to have more chances to influence their lives. It involves more than just moving individuals through the line and filling pill bottles. It involves reminding patients to continue taking their medications on time, dispensing health advice, and ensuring that everyone has had their questions addressed before leaving.
 
Rita is sick of idling her time. She wants techs who are completely trained from the start so she won't have to waste any more time training them. She wants to assist in finding a solution to the issue of recruiting more competent technicians and wonders if there is a breakdown in the hiring process. She also wants a speedier computer system so that she can work more quickly. She might be processing more prescriptions rather than spending time by scrolling through a cumbersome system. Momentum is everything in this job for Rita. She is aware that if she pauses even for a split second, chaos will ensue and she will be left with a huge mess. She needs a faster computer system and better software to keep up with the workload.
 
**Bernadette,  a Case manager**

Interviewing the patient is where her initial assessment starts. She is responsible for making a care plan involving doctors and nurses for related patients. She is delighted that she can give undivided attention to patients for their post-discharge individual needs, even when patients' families are interviewing them. She also does the job of advocating for the patients on behalf of the insurance case manager and ensuring that all the clinical information is correct to move forward with. This clinical information is further used for moving patients from hospital to home or from hospital to rehab. She feels mightily rewarded working as a case manager, as the atmosphere here is very family-type. Doctors here, as well as nurses, do go above and beyond for the patient, and the feedback that I get from the patient always says that they enjoy coming back here. Patients don't want to go to other places, even if they are nearby.

Bernadette has used a lot of applications in the past at her previous jobs as a case manager. She noticed that managing patients' information using multiple screens is very daunting and a waste of time. As she is always busy with the patients, She needs a management system to manage all the data simultaneously and prioritize patients' requirements.

**Appointment**

It is possible to get the iOS app "Case Notes" from the App Store. It keeps track of every patient, doctor, appointment, and schedule that occurs at every medical facility. It maintains a number of users, including a case manager, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and patient. To preserve secrecy, the case manager is allowed to perform operations on more delicate and private papers and modules that contain various pieces of information about doctors and patients. The system facilitates user-level registration of new patients. The hospital staff registers doctors. One can schedule an appointment with a doctor from their patient account, as well as view the doctor's details and all of their scheduled appointments.
One will also receive the additional benefit of being able to message a doctor about their illness and receive a response if they consent beforehand. In order to schedule an appointment, the patient can access the case notes application, choose a doctor from the list, check the doctor's availability against their own, and then book an appointment. The doctor will then be informed of the appointment and given the opportunity to confirm it. The application will then notify both parties of the confirmation. The app offers the option to also reschedule the appointment.

**Nurse Practitioner viewing notifications and reminder**

Laura is a skilled nurse who excels at planning and caring for patients. She is constantly busy caring for a variety of patients and following the doctors' orders.
Managing instructions from doctors and patients has been increasingly challenging recently due to a rise in patients and the hiring of additional doctors. For the directions and medicines given by the doctors, she must consult written notes. In order to remind the patients about their medical problems, availability, and other basic information, she must also phone them. Because of this, Laura struggles to send out reminders on time and manageably cluttered instructions.
Laura wants to manage notifications and reminders more intelligently. She wants to check the patients' updates and reminders on her phone.

**Case manager getting patient records at one place**

As a case manager, Bernadette oversees patient cases. She has made the decision to organize patient cases by looking at insurance providers, speaking with their respective managers, and considering the impact of their past, such as when they first claimed insurance. And is it already paid for that time period?
Patient George was discharged from the hospital today, and in order to help the insurance processes, she needed information such as when George filed his insurance, whether it is paid on time, whether there are any backlogs, etc.
Additionally, she inquired about George's condition and how he was feeling at the time, as well as whether any additional operations had been recommended for him.
She believed that because there were so many patients being discharged, it would take a lot of time and effort to complete this question-and-answer session.
She uses a case management application to gather all of this information in one location. There are still more of these meetings to be held, and if any of them have reminders, she can use the application right away to arrange them with the patient for the next step in the process.


**Case Manager managing patients**

Bernadette is a case manager, managing cases of patients. She has decided to organize patient cases, by looking at insurance companies to talk with their respective managers and impact of their history like when they claimed the insurance? And is it paid earlier for that period?.

She also asked and took notes on what’s the current condition of George like how is feeling now?, and are there some other procedures prescribed for him?. 
She felt that it's very time consuming and tedious to do this question answer session as she have to cover many more discharging patients for the same. 
To put all this data in one place, she uses Case Management Application. Also there are  more such meetings to be done, for every meeting if there is a reminder she can immediately use the application and schedule the meeting with patient for further process.
As she got reminder for meeting with patient named George from the application, she interviewed him immediately and got all the details required and moved forward with meeting of insurance company named aetna.
Bernadette follows organized dataflow. So, for every patient she needs immidiate data search of specific thing like patient records, admitted date, discharge date and other things on tip of finger.
One day, she had interaction with patient named Sonya. In her case, she had just got discharged from hospital and came for follow-up check up and further treatment. Because of this, Bernadette wants to access name of doctor who operated on her for surgery. With the help of Case management application she got to know about Name of Doctor and Nurses who helped for surgery. As all data was on same windows she had no issue to get names without wasting any time.  She further checked appointment through the same application and did check-in for her.
